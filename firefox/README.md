# Firefox config file

### Put it in .mozilla/firefox/<random-number>.default/chrome/

## What it does?
### Makes it possible to have rows of tabs, instead of 1 row

## Cool aditions to firefox:
- Saka key (vim keys)
- One tab (squash all tabs in 1 tab)
- Always right (open a new tab on the right of the current tab instead at the very end)
